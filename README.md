A wordle statistics scraper.

Scrapes Twitter postings of people's Wordle results and compiles it to find the number of people who guessed it in
1,2,3,4,5,6 or didn't guess it at all. Also finds the mean of the data and highlights that on the bar graph.

Create a config.py file with a Twitter Developer consumer key, secret consumer key, access token, secret access token,
and bearer token in order to use the scraper and stats files.
